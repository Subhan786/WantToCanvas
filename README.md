###Make and HTML5 canvas game!

This is one of a series of 3 newbie friendly projects for 24 Pull Requests: http://24pullrequests.com/.

We want you to help us to build an HTML5 game, we are open to the concept and complexity. We suggests to start with a story or idea that you can add on this README!

If you have never made a canvas game before start with this code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <title>Founders & Coders</title>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="canvas" width="500" height="500"/>
</body>
</html>
```

Other than that, do whatever you think is best. If you want inspiration, help or advise, feel free to message the founders & coders team. Find us here: https://github.com/foundersandcoders.
